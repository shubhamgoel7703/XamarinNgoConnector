The core of our libraries is our activity based library programme called GROW BY Reading which was developed after 3 years of study and research into the learning problems faced by children and challenges faced in schools, quality and quantity of vernacular childrenâs literature available and the attitude towards libraries. Through this programme we assess the reading levels of children, lead them to read books at their skill levels and help improve their reading comprehension and fluency at a pace that they are comfortable with. We also train and empower librarians to run these libraries. The programme is currently available in 4 languages â Kannada, Urdu, Tamil and English and is being developed in Hindi.We have partnered with 13 organisations in Karnataka to set up libraries and implement our library programme in 37 government schools, 22 community centres and 6 low-end private schools reaching out to over 17,000 children. We have also expanded into Tamil Nadu through a partnership with the Arcot Lutheran Church to set up 99 libraries in government schools in semi-urban and rural areas which will help us reach out to 30,000 children. We have also expanded our programme to rural India, with libraries in three villages of the Chitradurga district of Karnataka."},"heading":"Details of Achievements :"},{"fields":{"Address":"No 525, 16th main, 3rd block, Koramangala, Bangalore - 560034","City":"bangalore","State":"Karnataka","Telephone":"080-41501724","E-mail":"learnmore[at]hippocampus[dot]in","Website Url":"http://www.hrfindia.org"},"heading":"Contact Details"}]},{"sections":[{"fields":{"Unique Id of VO/NGODescription":"KA/2009/0013488","Chief Functionary":"NAGARATHNA","Chairman":"NAGARATHNA","Secretary":"SOMANATH","Treasurer":"HARSHA","Promoter Name 1":"SHALINI","Promoter Name 2":"SHALINI","Promoter Name 3":"SHALINI"},"heading":"NGODescription Name : SRI GURU SWAYAM SEVA SAMITHI"},{"fields":{"Registered With":"Sub-Registrar","Type of NGODescription":"Trust","Registration No":"4SFV/243/171-180/227-2001-02","City of Registration":"BANGALORE","State of Registration":"Karnataka","Date of Registration":"26-12-2001","Copy of Registration Certificate":"Available"},"heading":"First Registration Details"},{"fields":{"Key Issues":"Women's Development & Empowerment","Operational Area-States":"Karnataka","Operational Area-District":"Bangalore"},"heading":"Sector/ Key Issues"},{"fields":{"Major Activities/Achievements":"Empirical Studies: 1: women and social responsibility social awareness to women promoting service mind Boosting their pure emotions spreading Enthusiasm Eradication of evil thoughts and elements advantages of balanced life style importance of peace and proslerity2.

Kendra,India(VVKI) is a registered public charitable trust constituted to promote spiritual, educational, cultural and social developmental activities for the benefit of the public. Constituted on 29th March 1996, the organization runs various programmes called the Art of Living courses, which are designed to develop personality, eliminate mental stress, and improve the physical health of an individual irrespective of economic status, caste or religion. The organisation also works to instil a sense of self-esteem in the youth and women of urban and rural India. It promotes educational, social, recreational, cultural and other activities that can strengthen and bring about a positive change in society. VVKI envisions a long-term, far-reaching social transformation to uplift individuals, families and communities through the Art of Living courses and other service projects to tap the full potential of human life. Organizational Structure VVKI is administered by a Board of Trustees (four members) at the registered Head Office in Bangalore. There is an Apex Body in every state in India, which is charge of all activities. At the district level, there are about 200 information centres. A large faculty of teachers, (about 5100 volunteer teachers of which 560 are fulltime teachers), conduct courses and spread knowledge among the people. In addition, several thousands of volunteers and organizers with varied backgrounds such as engineering, medicine, management, etc. help the organization in their various service projects. The 5H PROGRAM: The organization has developed the 5H Programme to uplift individuals, families, communities and the entire Nation so that finer human qualities are nurtured. The five main areas of focus are Health, Homes, Hygiene, Human Values, and Harmony in Diversity. Based on this unique approach, the 5H Program recognizes that no external agent can bring about lasting change in the society. It has to come from within the community to ensure sustainability. Therefore, recruitment and training of young people from the villages lies at the core of the approach. The Youth Leadership Training Program (YLTP) empowers young people to become leaders in the development process and to act as catalytic agents for bringing social change in their communities. Since the inception of YLTP in 1999, 450 courses have been organized in which over 50,000 youths were trained. A large number of youths trained under the programme are now engaged in the 5H program. The other major projects being run by VVKI are : Tribal Welfare Program â Tribal areas are earmarked for basic amenity support, like drinking water supply. Schools are running since 1999 in 3 Eastern / North Eastern States with a major tribal population, imparting the much needed basic education with free books, food and uniforms.. Trauma Relief and rehabilitation programs â In case of natural calamities eg. Bihar Flood etc. Prisoner Rehabilitation program â running across the country in various prisons.

We aim at sustainment of Theatre Aesthetics in the field of Kannada Stage. To move towards this aim, we decided to take up the production of traditional play KURUKSHETRA. Gopalakrishna Nayari inaugurated the institute with his background of National School of Drama New Delhi. Thus the organization Natya Saraswathi Shanthala Kannada Kala Sangha came into existence. Under his direction we gave performance on 1st of November 1985. Afterwards Mahaprabhu Magadi Kempegowda written by K. Karimkhan was staged on October 2nd 1990.On 3rd April 1991, we got our organization registered under the Karnataka State Societies registration Act bearing number S.No.21/91-92 dated 3rd April 1991. Here afterwards we are making two new productions with 25 to 30 performances including repeat shows of our land mark productions. We gave much importance to Research activities conducted by the playwrights to explore new plays. Such productions we made are Samrat Sreepurusha, Bangalore Bhagyalakshmi, Nadaprabhu Kempegowda written by Anjaneya, Kaneena by Kuvempu, Seekarne Savithri by T.P Kailasam produced in Veeragase Style, Sevanthi Prasanga and Palenkaru. Added to this we made productions of smaller duration like Yamabandhu, Tippu Sultan, Samrat Suyodhana, Kumara Rama etc. We are making our productions as a landmark in Kannada theatre thereby extending our limits to the National Theatre for example our Samrat Shreepurusha is a historical play. It was produced dismantling traditional style of historical plays of using one truck load of properties. Instead of this we adopted martial arts and simple weapons like Swords, Bow and Arrows, Barji, Mace to indicate the locations. It has given a new dimensions and kaleidoscope vision for the production. This showed a new way for the production of historical plays on cheaper cost but gorgeous look. We organize theatre festivals like Pancha Ratrigala Rangothsava for five days, Ranga Sourabha for 3 days and Kirunatakothsava for 1 day consisting of 3 to 4 short plays. We are also executing theatre Ballet such as Kempegowda, Nruthya Roopaka, Kanaka Kanda Krishna, Swathanthrya Deepa etc. We are conducting full time and short time theatre workshops. In these workshops theatre experts provide information on Acting, Mask Making, Mime, Make-up, Lighting, Stage designing, Stage Craft costume designing etc. Further our activities scoped with Seminars, Folk performing Arts, Felicitations etc. We have conducted Seminar on Nairyâs Hadiyatta Karnabhara in Modern Indian Theatre, Fusion Possibilities of Ballet in Theatre-Kempegowda, Finding Possibilities of Adopting Historical Plays on modern theatre-Sree Purusha etc. We are working towards Disseminate and Promote Folk forms like Hidambi Swayamwara-Bayalatta, Somana Kunitha, Marikunitha etc. Theatre personalities like late Shri B.V. Karanth, N.S.Venkataram, G.V.Shivanand interacted with our organization. Now it is our pride we are using services of H.V.Venkatasubbaiah, V.Ramamurthy, Gopalakrishna Nayari and others.

One of the major contributions of Spandana to the field of Theatre has been the extensive research undertaken by the group for the documentation and experimentation of the rich and varied folk art forms such as âKinnari Joogeraataâ, âBayalaataâ, âBhooteraataâ, âGondaligara Melaâ, âVeeragaaseâ, which are found in and around Karnataka. The uniqueness of this process followed by Spandana provides the opportunity for the artistes to specialize not only in Acting but also Singing, Dancing and playing many instruments. This has enabled the group Spandana to compile in its archives more than 300 hours of Audio & Video recordings of the Folk and Traditional music & narratives. Other significant contributions of Spandana have been the adaptation of various novels, short stories and poetry. The play âSadaarameâ has brought back the glory of the company theatre style to the modern era. Spandana can boast of successfully and innovatively adapting Henrik Ibsenâs play âThe Master Builderâ as âBaalura Gudikaraâ and having gained accolades. Spandana strives to provide theatre-goers and critics with plays to remember both for its aesthetics and production values. Dr. B.

Activities/Achievements":"The Sri Sri Institute of Agricultural Sciences & Technology Trust is established by H. H. Sri Sri Ravishankarji with the main objective to provide opportunities in education, research and extension in different branches of Agriculture.Our Trust launched a major initiative âMission Green Earthâ in 2008. It is a long term Eco-initiative to protect natural resources of land, soil, water and vegetation. As you are well aware the natural resources in India are being over-exploited in Agriculture. In the initial stages our programmes facilitate interaction with farmers and public to apprise them of the causes for decline in crop productivity, escalation in production costs resulting in higher consumer prices. The seminars, lectures and demonstrations have already created awareness in farmers about the dangers in chemical farming. The Trust is going further in search of remedial solutions for some of the major environmental degradation factors in the experiments with the farmers and also scientists. The farmers are aware now, more than ever, that chemical farming brought about not only a dwindling in income and great loss of soil fertility but also damaged their land and water resources. The Departments of Agriculture and all line departments express anxiety over loss of productivity in the States and are looking for NGODescription initiatives to launch projects and programs to intensify input management of seeds, fertilizers.On the other side of this vicious circle, people and consumers feel alarmed with chemical residues and unsafe food they are forced to buy. The industries have also been over-exploiting the farmers on the one hand and consumers are required to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce, processed or semi processed.Our training programmes on chemical -free and zero budget Agriculture have yielded positive results so far. Yet to make it sustainable, an integrated approach to improve soil fertility and productivity is required. The Centerâs initiatives have been greatly welcomed by farming community but the bottleneck at present is the need for transferring of technology of processing. To make the farmers manage their own units and get into marketing themselves is the true challenge. We need to facilitate interfacing of production process with processing and marketing of agricultural produce."},"heading":"Details of Achievements :"},{"fields":{"Address":"21st km, Kanakpura Road,

We are not sorry for having taken a long time to learn the lessons, for, inspite of the restrained approach we adopted DEVELOPMENT FORUM has conducted 18 Health related activities,13 Old-age management activities, 4 Skill enhancement programmes, 4 Watershed development programmes, 3 Cultural awareness programmes,2 Forest awareness programmes,1 Education related programme, 1 Animal welfare programme. In tune to our principles, we had to generate resources and funds from a small pocket and defined area of operation. Within this limited scope of finance and resourcing we have been able to mobilize resources worth 20 lakh rupees and use 95% of this on productive spheres of activity. In tune to our principle of not using the raised funds on non-productive spheres of activities, DEVELOPMENT FORUM avoided having any administrative or field staff on their pay rolls. Instead the DEVELOPMENT FORUM members volunteered to engage themselves for about 400 days to survey the afflicted areas,650 days to organize the activities, 125 days to publicise the schemes,550 days to implementing the schemes, 200 days to follow-up,150 days to administer and document. All the members of DEVELOPMENT FORUM are gainfully employed for their living needs. And giving more than 60% of their leisure time for such a long period to social development activities displays the sustained commitment for the cause.
